# Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

## What is a PWA?

- A PWA is a website that feels like an app.

- It works on any device (mobile, tablet, or desktop).

- No need to download from an app store‚Äîjust open the website and install it.

- PWAs work offline, load fast, and can send push notifications.

## Why were PWAs created?

- People spend more time on apps than on websites.

- But downloading apps is a hassle‚Äîmany users don‚Äôt want to install them.

- PWAs remove friction‚Äîjust open the site, and it's ready to go.

- They are cheaper and easier to maintain than native apps (iOS/Android).

## Features of a PWA

A PWA is different from a normal website because it has:

- **Works on Any Device** ‚Äì Responsive design, looks good on mobile & desktop.

- **Fast & Smooth** ‚Äì Pages load instantly, even on slow networks.

- **Works Offline** ‚Äì Caches pages so they open without the internet.

- **Installable** ‚Äì Users can add it to their home screen like an app.

- **Secure** ‚Äì Always served over HTTPS to protect data.

- **Push Notifications** ‚Äì Can send updates like a native app.

- **Updates Automatically** ‚Äì No need to update manually like a native app.

## Key Technologies That Make a PWA Work

### 1. Service Workers (The Brain of a PWA)

- A Service Worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background.

- It handles caching so pages load even without the internet.

- It intercepts network requests‚Äîmeaning it can decide what to load from the cache or fetch from the internet.

- It also enables push notifications and background sync.

üîπ Example:
You open a PWA with the internet ‚Üí The Service Worker saves some files.
Next time you open it without the internet ‚Üí The Service Worker loads the saved files instead of showing an error.

### 2. Web App Manifest (Makes a PWA Installable)

- A manifest.json file tells the browser how the PWA should look when installed.

- It contains:

  - App Name ‚Äì The name of the app.
  - Icons ‚Äì The app icon for the home screen.
  - Theme Color ‚Äì Custom colors for a native feel.
  - Start URL ‚Äì The page the app should open when launched.
  - Display Mode ‚Äì Can be fullscreen, standalone (no browser UI), or minimal UI.

- Generate Manifest:

- The manifest.json file should be in public folder in order to access it.

### 3. HTTPS (Security Requirement for PWAs)

- PWAs must be served over HTTPS for security reasons.

- This ensures data encryption and protects against hacking attempts.

- Without HTTPS, Service Workers won‚Äôt work.

- Exception: You can test locally without HTTPS (localhost).

### 4. PWA vs Normal Websites vs Native Apps

### 5. Real-World Examples of PWAs

- Twitter Lite ‚Äì 70% less data usage, 65% more pages viewed.

- Pinterest PWA ‚Äì 60% more engagement.

- Starbucks PWA ‚Äì Works offline, smaller than native app.

- Uber PWA ‚Äì Loads in 2 seconds, even on 2G networks.

## Common Questions about PWA

### 1. How do Service Workers update?

- The old Service Worker keeps running until all pages close.

- When the user reopens the app, the new version replaces the old one.

### 2. Can PWAs use phone features like GPS, camera, or Bluetooth?

Yes! PWAs can access:

- Camera (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia).

- GPS (navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition).

- Bluetooth (navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice).

‚ö†Ô∏è But some features (Face ID, fingerprint scan) are not allowed.

### 3. Do PWAs work on iOS and Android?

‚úÖ Android: Full PWA support (installable, push notifications, offline mode).

‚ö†Ô∏è iOS: Limited support (before iOS 16.4, no push notifications).

### 4. Why Should Businesses Use PWAs?

- Lower Development Cost ‚Äì No need for separate iOS/Android apps.

- Faster Performance ‚Äì Loads instantly, works on low-end devices.

- Higher Engagement ‚Äì Users return because of push notifications.

- No App Store Needed ‚Äì No approval delays, instant updates.
